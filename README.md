# Coinhunt

Someone created a "puzzle" where he chose keys in a certain smaller space and sent increasing amounts to each of those keys.
Possibly set up by Satoshi himself it is a complex puzzle who's only hint is that the BTC are spaced by bit size up to 2160.

Currently, the easiest unsolved puzzle is puzzle 64, that is what this script aims to accomplish.
